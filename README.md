Bikelog

**Bikelog** is a Ruby on Rails 3 application to manage the GPS track
logs of your bike rides.  As it is still in the early development phase,
a lot of (advanced) features are missing, but the basic functionality
is already implemented.


Features
--------

* Google Maps displaying your tracks
* Statistics (distance, duration, average speeds, ascent etc.)
* Graphical representation of your 12-month activity by distance and duration
* Elevation profiles
* GPX import and export
